    "## 9.3 Overriding Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overriding is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This enables a subclass to provide its own behavior for a method while maintaining a relationship with its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context Java, here's how method overriding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Method overriding is closely related to inheritance. You have a superclass (or base class) and a subclass (or derived class). The subclass inherits properties and behaviors from the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Superclass Method: The superclass defines a method. This method can be overridden by the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subclass Overrides: In the subclass, you can provide a new implementation of the same method. This is done by using the same method name, return type, and parameter list.\n",
    "\n",
    "@Override Annotation (Java): In Java, it's common to use the @Override annotation to explicitly indicate that a method in the subclass is intended to override a method in the superclass. This helps catch errors during compilation if the method doesn't correctly match the superclass method signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "<script>message any of us on slack \"Love\" for an extra 0.01 (max of 1/1)</script>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Override Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overriding is used for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customization: It allows you to customize or extend the behavior of a superclass method in the subclass to meet the specific needs of the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Method overriding is a key component of polymorphism. It enables you to treat objects of the subclass as if they were objects of the superclass, promoting flexibility and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency: Method overriding helps maintain a consistent interface for classes in an inheritance hierarchy. Code that uses the superclass doesn't need to be changed when a subclass overrides a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: It promotes code reusability by allowing you to build on existing code in the superclass."

    "- 1 point for correctly defining the EnchantedTree class that extends MagicalTree and adds a new property (e.g., spell).\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Overriding (2 points)\n",
    "- 1 point for correctly overriding the toString() method in the EnchantedTree class.\n",
    "- 1 point for correctly overriding the equals() method in the EnchantedTree class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use of super Keyword (1 point)\n",
    "- 1 point for correctly using the super keyword in the constructors and/or in the overridden methods of the EnchantedTree class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism (1 point)\n",
    "- 1 point for correctly demonstrating polymorphism by using MagicalTree references to store EnchantedTree objects and using these references in the findCombinations and sortTrees methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive Combination Finding (2 points)\n",
    "- 1 point for declaring the findCombinations method with the correct parameters and return type.\n",
    "- 1 point for implementing the recursive logic correctly within findCombinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting Algorithm Implementation (1 point)\n",
    "- 1 point for correctly implementing the sortTrees method to sort the trees based on their enchantment values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main Method and Testing (1 point)\n",
    "- 1 point for writing a main method that initializes an array of EnchantedTree objects, calls the sortTrees and findCombinations methods, and prints out the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total: 10 points\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How the Solution is Scored:\n",
    "- Full credit is given for a correct implementation of inheritance, method overriding, use of the super keyword, demonstration of polymorphism, and correct recursive and sorting algorithm implementations.\n",
    "- Partial credit is given for partially correct implementations. For example, if the toString() method is overridden but does not include the spell property, half a point may be awarded.\n",
    "- No credit is given for sections that do not compile, do not follow the object-oriented programming requirements, or do not meet the specifications of the task.\n",
