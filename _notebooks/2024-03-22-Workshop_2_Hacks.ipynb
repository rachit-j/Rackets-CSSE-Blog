    "## Question 1 - Pojos and Access Control:\n",
    "Situation: The school librarian wants to create a program that stores all of the books within the library in a database and is used to manage their inventory of books available to the students. You decided to put your amazing code skills to work and help out the librarian!\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Describe the key differences between the private and public access controllers and how it affects a POJO\n",
    "\n",
    "The key differences between the private and public access controlers in Java is that Public allows for the widest possible accessability, while private restricts the accessability to the class itself. A public can be accessed from any class, even outside of the original class. Meanwhile, private objects can only be accessed from the class itself, not from outside. In a Plain Old Java Object (POJO), which is a simple Java object with private fields and public getters and setters, these access controllers play a large role. The fields of a POJO are typically declared private to encapsulate the data and prevent unauthorized access or modification. Public getters and setters are programmed to allow controlled access to these fields, following the principle of encapsulation in OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Identify a scenario when you would use the private vs. public access controllers that isn't the one given in the scenario above\n",
    "\n",
    "A scenario when I would use the private vs. public is banking. In a banking application, the balance of a bank account would be declared as a private field. This is because direct access to the balance should be restricted to prevent unauthorized modifications. Access to the balance is provided through public methods such as deposit() and withdraw() that enforce rules and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Create a Book class that represents the following attributes about a book: title, author, date published, person holding the book and make sure that the objects are using a POJO, the proper getters and setters and are secure from any other modifications that the program makes later to the objects\n"

    "Within a constructor, generally the attributes of the class are initialized with values. This can be done directly or through parameters passed to the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Create an example of an overloaded constructor within a class. You must use at least three variables. Include the correct initialization of variables and correct headers for the constructor. Then, run the constructor at least twice with different variables and demonstrate that these two objects called different constructors. "
