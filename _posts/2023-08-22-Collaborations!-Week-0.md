### Here is a summary of my collaborations this week with my partner Grace
:D

Grace and I collaborated on a multitude of problems, some of which include
- A problem with Java not showing up in my Jupyter Notebook
- A problem with Grace's website where all her hard work and styles suddenly dissapeared
- A problem with my tables that did not allow me to use the pipe function to let me make tables
- A problem where Grace did not know how to display the images in her blog
- A problem with me not understanding how to make a post
- A problem where Grace accidentally forgot to update her website configuration
- A problem where my images kept on getting deleted

Grace and I collaborated over FaceTime at home so that we could help each other out with our issues. Here is a pic of us on FaceTime!

Grace also helped me draw my [freeform pic](/Rackets-Blog/) (and tell me how to draw)
