# Introduction

Imagine Spotify but for Stocks...

### ðŸ’¥STOCKTIFYðŸ’¥

  

We all know the need for stocks in the modern world. Stocks are one of the hardest but most used passive income methods. However, many people find it hard to get the information behind their stocks, including some general facts like the P/E ratio and annual growth rate, which is why we have created Stocktify!

  

Imagine something like a Spotify, but for stocks. Stocktify is the revolutionary stock page, which demonstrates as much as information as possible, and will try to always include basic facts about stocks that will help you make decisions, without any pay-to-win barriers. Stocktify also brings around a new method of stock organization. By creating "playlists," you can organize stocks based on your own preferences, and can watch and categorize specific stocks, just like you would with music. By playing a "playlist," you can get accurate, consolidated data about all your stocks on one page. Stocktify promises to revolutionize how we consolidate stocks. By bringing in consolidated sources together, we are determined to make jobs like stock management easy enough for the average person to easily do.

  

Moreover, Stocktify will come with a built in convolutional neural network. Although simple, this neural network will be able to determine whether you should buy the stock or not. This neural network will not be perfect, however, and will not dictate what you will be able to do with your stocks, but will simply give you suggestions if you ask for it. The model cannot predict the future, therefore, we do not take responsibility if any non-desired effects come from using the model. Use the model at your own risk.

_Yahoo Finance: As you can see, this does not give insight into numbers we want; we do not have a P/E ratio, Growth to Earnings ratio, Dividend Yield and Dividend Growth, Debt-to-Equity Ratio, ROE, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and the Moving Average._

_This is all due to pay-to-access information, and if you want to find it manually, you need to google search._

# Current Progress (As of September 28)

As of today, we have been able to complete the following:

*   Create and deploy the backend and frontend
