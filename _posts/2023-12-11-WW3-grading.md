## Issues

# Reflection
We realized that we had trouble carrying out our ideation to meet requirements of the project. Because of this our ideation was delayed and we had to make up for lost time.

## Retrospective ðŸ’¡
This project was a wonderful journey through the different types of sorts and we got to learn a lot about the java process. We wanted to target a lot of things, but for the scope and requirements of our project, as well as the time it took us to ideate and plan out our project, we were not able to completely make a resemblance of our original game: War. However, we believe that we were able to match our requirements for what we wanted the game to have and the requirements that the project needed. Overall, I think we did a great job balancing everything out and trying to include everything that we possibly could. Although our game has slightly deviated from the original war game, and the fact that we were not able to completely finish some goals (ex. different card ranks) due to some crunches and the project requirements, as well as our ideation time, we feel like we have been able to show our knowledge about Java and sorting algorithms, as well as fibonacci, with a lot of growth and improvement. We learned many things along the way, and we cannot wait to learn more as we go on an adventure with the Zesty Rachits!
