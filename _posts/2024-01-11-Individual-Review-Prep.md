## Key Assets

### aigf
Took down the deployment as too many of my friends were "looking into it"

Basic Node server, but pretty cool. Fine tuning the model was fun.

[Link to Showcase for AIGF](https://github.com/rachit-j/aigf/issues/1)
*All steps of the plan are still not complete D:*

### Stocktify

[Bot Homepage](https://stocktifybot.vercel.app/)

Designed the AI bot for stocktify that could be called as an external API

[Neural Net Analysis](https://theoh32.github.io/Stocktify/analysis)

Created a neural network that used a couple sample stocks to make predicitons, all written in Java first and then in JavaScript.

Learned and Made APIs, managed them on the frontend.

Learned somewhat how to deploy, courtesy of Theo! 

Scrum Master: [Scrum for Stocktify](https://app.clickup.com/9011012769/v/l/4-90110133665-1)

### WW3
**NOT** scrum master.

Actually learned how to deploy and learned different kinds of sorting. 

Backend Deployment, Fibonacci, and Sorting. [Review for WW3](https://github.com/rachit-j/ww3/issues/6)

### Plan for the actual test
W3 Schools. Not even kidding.

*I am not kidding it took me a whole day to make this*

## Passion
**I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT FOOLING THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. THAT IS MY GOAL!**

You know when you dont want to write 10 english essays. Yeah, I know. This is why I will be working on a bot that can write essays based off of student samples, and make it original enough to pass turnitin and other checking systems.

Already working on this for a club tho soooooooooooooo maybe I want to get into gaming like the Legend of Zelda, because those games and their physics interest me.
