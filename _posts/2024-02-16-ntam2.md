# Two Trimester focus planning

## Test Data & Feedback
We got a lot of test data from other people on our project. Lots of people tested our signup and login, which means our signup and login is good to go. We also got a lot of feedback on changing our `/fight` page, as there were a lot of pixels that did not match the correct size and style of the page. Moreover, our answer text was hard to read and people had trouble answering the questions. Finally, the `\n` tag did not work, which is something which we should fix.

# Team Reflection
As a team and as the Head Scrum Master, I felt like that we could have done better by connecting and integrating each aspect of our project together, even though we all worked on everything. I felt like as a team, we were fluid, but our project topics were more rigid and confined, which is something we will be fixing going into the third trimester. However, we worked really well as a team, able to cover areas that needed to be covered in times of need. For example, when suddenly get dumped with loads of Scrum work, Finn and Luna help me break it down as little scrum. The same applies to Theo in the admin/frontend, Finn with the fight, and more.
