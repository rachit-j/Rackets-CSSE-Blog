# Individual Progress

Over the course of this year, I have progressed a lot individually.

## AP Preparation Progress

I have come to the point where I am able to understand and complete a good variety of FRQ's, however, they take me time to read and understand, which is a drawback I am trying to work on. Also, I would like to practice them on paper, as that is what the real AP exam will be like. Why a computer science test is on paper, I don't know.

## Personal Spotlight: Documentation and Organization with Integration

This trimester, I have been working a lot, as scrum master, to keep our documentation updated and logged so that we can refer to it at a later date and we know what everyone else is doing without having to constantly bug and ping them. Showcase on diffent documentations, logging, and tracking of goals.

# Project work

Together, we work as a cohesive team to assign roles and responsibilites, while performing tasks on our own or with a pair. We have weekly meetings on Sundays, meetings throughout the weeks at night, and meeting in preparation for an event several days in advance till the next day. Check the codemaxxer issues page in the personal spotlight for more details.
