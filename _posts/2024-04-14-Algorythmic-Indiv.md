## Reflection

A lot of the sorts were done extremely well. The pool noodle sort headed by Varalu was a little confusing, but it was still extremely fun to watch. The murder mystery presented by Aiden's group was also extremely engaging and the revelation was also humerous, which was why it was my favorite performance. 

I also loved our TikToks, which really helped to spread our performance. The people in my stats class also saw the TikToks, sadly. 

We were praised for having legible numbers and clearly describing our sort, as well as maintaining a degree of humor and fun with our setting and scenario. 

Working to determine the positioning was also a challenge, but we spent some time together and were able to figure it out.
