## Collegeboard Quiz
Things I looked up:
- How to define an arraylist
- Public VS Private syntax and information

The things that I can improve on are arraylist practice and revisiting public versues private (that specific collegeboard unit)

### Questions I missed
![Question 15](/Rackets-Blog/images/question15.png)

I got this question wrong because I was not paying attention to the traversal of ArrayLists. In the future, I will be better prepared for this. The reason II is wrong is because if you reach the max `k`, then you will have an `index out of bounds` error from `k + 1`.

![Question 28](/Rackets-Blog/images/question28.png)

I got confused by all the junk in the middle here, I just had to look at the conditional flows for `n` and ignore the other variables. Whoopsie.
